Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm

OS replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in future.

Input : Number of frames, fn = 3
Reference String, pg[] = {7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1};
Output :  No. of hits = 11 
                 No. of misses = 9

Input : Number of frames, fn = 4 
        Reference String, pg[] = {7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2};
Output : No. of hits = 7
                No. of misses = 6

The idea is simple, for every reference we do following :
If referred page is already present, increment hit count.
If not present, find if a page that is never referenced in future. If such a page exists, replace this page with new page. If no such page exists, find a page that is referenced farthest in future. Replace this page with new page.
